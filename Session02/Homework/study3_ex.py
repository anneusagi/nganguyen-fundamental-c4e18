#3. What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals

Nested conditional means that you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
